**Sag-free Initialization for Strand-based Hybrid Hair Simulation**
- Paper: https://graphics.cs.utah.edu/research/projects/sag-free-hair/sig23_sagfree-hair.pdf
- Project Website: https://graphics.cs.utah.edu/research/projects/sag-free-hair/
- Tags: Hair Simulation, Strand-based
- Abstract:
  > *This paper proposes a novel four-stage, sag-free initialization framework to solve stable quasistatic configurations for hybrid, strand-based hair dynamic systems. Our results show that our method successfully prevents sagging on various hairstyles and has minimal impact on the hair motion during simulation.*

**CT2Hair: High-Fidelity 3D Hair Modeling using Computed Tomography**
- Code: https://github.com/facebookresearch/CT2Hair
- Project Website: http://yuefanshen.net/CTHair
- Abstract:
  > *We introduce CT2Hair, a fully automatic framework for creating high-fidelity 3D hair models using computed tomography. Our approach utilizes real-world hair wigs as input and is able to reconstruct hair strands for a wide range of hair styles. The 3D hair models are suitable for use in downstream graphics applications.*

**Interactive Hair Simulation on the GPU Using ADMM**
- Paper: https://d1qx31qr3h6wln.cloudfront.net/publications/Interactive%20Hair%20Simulation%20on%20the%20GPU%20Using%20ADMM.pdf
- Project Website: https://research.nvidia.com/publication/2023-08_interactive-hair-simulation-gpu-using-admm
- Abstract:
  > *We design and validate a local-global solver dedicated to the simulation of Kirchhoff rods with Coulomb friction that can fully leverage the massively parallel compute capabilities of moderns GPUs, enabling interactive physics-based simulation and authoring of virtual grooms.*

**A Practical Wave Optics Reflection Model for Hair and Fur**
- Paper: https://mandyxmq.github.io/research/assets/WaveFiber3d_paper_compress.pdf
- Project Website: https://mandyxmq.github.io/research/wavefiber_3d.html
- Abstract:
  > *We propose a practical model for simulating wave effects from rough fibers with arbitrary 3D microgeometry. This model can be easily combined with existing scattering models to render hair and fur of various colors, adding colorful glints that were missing from previous models.*
